## How to start a new facility branch

[![start-facility](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1221423/235727646-4a590299-ffe5-480d-8cd5-8194ea184546.svg "Start facility")](https://github.com/new?,template_owner=YOUR-ORG-OR-USERNAME&template_name=YOUR-REPO-NAME&owner=%40me&name=facility-branch&description=My+facility+repository&visibility=public)

1. **Right-click “Start facility”** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most fields will be pre-filled:
   - **Repository Owner**: Choose your personal account or an organization.
   - **Repository Name**: We pre-filled with `facility-branch`, but feel free to rename it to `facility-<YourFacilityName>` or anything that identifies your facility.
   - **Description**: Briefly describe your facility’s customizations.
   - **Visibility**: We recommend public so you can use GitHub Actions freely without consuming private Actions minutes (if that matters to you).
3. Scroll down and click **Create repository**.

Once GitHub finishes creating your new repository, you’ll have a copy of all files from this template. Follow the step-by-step instructions in your newly created repository’s README to:

- Create a custom branch name for your facility (e.g. `facility-MyUniversity`).
- Commit changes.
- Open a Pull Request to merge your facility’s branch back into [**main**](./../../) (if/when you want to share improvements).
